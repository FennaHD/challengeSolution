Wrote challenge solution in C++11.

When running the solution I made a few assumptions. The menu has the option of whether to translate modern numbers or Roman numerals. I assume that the user will enter an appropriate option and an appropriate answer to the prompt. There's some error handling.

Took me 1 hour and 42 minutes to write the answer and create the github repository.
